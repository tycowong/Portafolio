A art display of the **Makeup Artist Emmy Fonseca**. Here you find Emmy's art and a means of contact. We wanted a big focus on the models in Emmy's portfolio. Looking great on mobile, but you can get outstanding detail on desktop.

This is the **first ever webpage I've built**. It's build only with **HTML** and **CSS**, we are planning to migrate this portfolio to Astro since it's pretty static and therefore, there is no need for javascript since the **focus of this portfolio are the portraits** of the models who display Emmy's art.
