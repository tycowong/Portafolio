While working in HP, one of the biggest projects I had was to **travel to different countries and record research interviews.** Before my contract ended, I decided to help the team by creating this documentation using the **Starlight template in Astro.**

This allowed me to **create a great site** where researchers could follow the documentation for the equipment I used in this big study. I used **MDX** as my formatting and documenting pages since **I was familiar with Markdown files** since I usually take notes in **Obsidian.**
