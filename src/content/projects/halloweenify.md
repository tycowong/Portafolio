Halloweenify was created for a **Hackathon hosted by Cloudinary** with a Halloween theme. Utilizing **Cloudinary's API**, you can transform your face appearance into one of the available Halloween characters.

The challenge of this hackathon was to use Claoudinary's services to create something that fits with the theme **Spooky AI Creation**.
