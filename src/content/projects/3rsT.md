This app was created unsing **Expo, Google Gemini, and Spotify API**. By taking the current track a user is currently listening in Spotify, we make a query to Gemini that will **return a recomendation of a alcoholic drink that would pair good with the song**.

The **ingredients of the bevrage will also be displayed**. I plan to add more feautes **links to the ingredients** used, a short TikTok or Reel that shows you how to make it, **creating our own repository of pictures**, etc.
